			<h4 >Governing Law; Arbitration</h4>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH POKIFIT AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM POKIFIT.
				In the event of any dispute relating to these Terms, you and Pokitfit agree to consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing your mutual interests, attempt to reach a solution within a period of 60 days. If not, either party may, by notice to the other, demand mediation under the mediation rules of the American Arbitration Association in San Francisco, California. In such case, we give up our right to litigate our disputes and may not proceed to arbitration without first attempting mediation. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Pokitfit will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.
				If settlement is not reached within 60 days after service of a written demand for mediation, any unresolved controversy or claim will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association before a single arbitrator in San Francisco, California. The language of all proceedings and filings will be English. The arbitrator will render a written opinion including findings of fact and law and the award and/or determination of the arbitrator will be binding upon the parties, and their respective administrators and assigns, and will not be subject to appeal. Judgment may be entered upon the award of the arbitrator in any court of competent jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration will be shared equally by the parties unless the arbitration determines that the expenses will be otherwise assessed and the prevailing party may be awarded its attorneys' fees and expenses by the arbitrator. It is the intent of the parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances, arbitration proceedings will be concluded within 90 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit only if failure to do so would unduly prejudice the rights of the parties. Failure to adhere to this time limit will not constitute a basis for challenging the award. Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, pre-hearing information exchange will be limited to the reasonable production of relevant, non-privileged documents, carried out expeditiously.
